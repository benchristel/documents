# Documents on the web

The World Wide Web was originally conceived as a way for internet users to share
documents with each other. Somewhere along the way, that idea got lost or
muddled. Most webpages, including my own, are "documents" only in the most
technical and abstract sense. They aren't self-contained. They're too
self-aware.
