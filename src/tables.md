Interesting asymmetrical two-player map. Both players have Nature towns, but one is restricted to wolves, tigers, griffins, and faerie dragons, while the other is restricted to sprites, elves, unicorns, and phoenixes. There is a third, computer-only player, whose town cannot be captured by either human player. The game ends when either player's town is captured. There are several portals and looped paths between the towns, and a couple gold mines to fight over.
