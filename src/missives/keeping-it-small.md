Programmers love small programs. We all know from experience that small programs are easier to write and maintain than big ones. But the world has big problems. What if we need big programs to solve them?

When the program's small it fits in your head. The code might even fit on your screen. When you make a change, you can see everything that might be affected by it.

As the program gets bigger, it no longer fits in your head. 


In order to answer this question, we'll have to take a closer look at

- what we mean by "a program"
- what we mean by "a big program"
- why an assembly of small programs is better than one big program.

## Programs

A program, for our purposes here, is the smallest transmissible unit of useful software. We buy, sell, download, and install programs, but we generally don't take them apart; they have "no user-serviceable parts inside." If we only have half the program, it's useless. Programs, by this definition, include apps, libraries, plugins, and web services.
