# A Grammar of the Dunysk Language

## Overall Typology

- SVO and VOS
- Mostly head-initial
- Two open word classes: nouns and verbs
- Verbs strictly mark syntactic valence
- Long and short phrases

### Allophony

When spelled _gh_, /j/ is realized as \[x\] between vowels.

### Spelling

Most sounds are represented by their IPA characters in the orthography. The
exceptions are listed below.

| Sound        | Spelling  | Example
| ------------ | --------- | -------
| /ŋ/          | _ng_      |
| /j/ ~ \[x\]  | _gh_, _j_ | _jegh_ "I"
| /k/          | _k_, _c_, _q_ |
| /ɾ/          | _r_       |
| /w/          | _ff_, _w_ | _loff_ "love"
| /þ/          | _th_      |
| /ð/          | _ð_, _dh_ |

| Sound        | Spelling  | Word-final spelling | Example
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------- | --------
| /iː/         | _ë_       | -                   | _sëgh_ "seen"
| /ɪ/          | _y_       | -                   |
| /ʏː/         | _ÿ_       | -
| /uː/         | _ö_       | -
| /e/          | -         | _e_
| /eː/         | _ä_       | -
| /ø/          | _ø_       | _ø_
| /ɛ/          | _e_       | _æ_
| /ɔ/          | _a_       | -
| /æ/          | _æ_       | -
| /ɐ/          | -         | _a_

### Stress

Stress falls on the first syllable of the root. The language has few prefixes,
so this almost always coincides with the first syllable of the word. Compound
verbs are an exception: a compound verb like _aplædha_ "donate, serve up, pitch
in," formed from _ap + lædha_, is stressed on the second syllable.

## Nominal Morphology

### Linking consonants

When suffixes in _-e-_ are attached to a noun stem in _-i_, _-y_, _-o_, _-ø_,
or _-u_, a linking consonant is introduced between the stem and the suffix.

| Final vowel of stem | Linking consonant |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| _-i_                | _-gh-_            |
| _-y_                | _-gh-_            |
| _-o_                | _-v-_             |
| _-ø_                | _-v-_             |
| _-u_                | _-v-_             |

### Final vowel elision

When suffixes in _-e-_ are attached to a noun stem in _-a_, _-e_ or _-æ_, the
final vowel of the stem is dropped.

### Number

The dictionary form of nouns is transnumeral, neither singular nor plural.
The singulative is formed by suffixing _-et_. The plural is formed by _-er_.
The form associated with "zero" or "none" is the transnumeral.

Examples: _hus_ "house or houses; shelter," _huset_ "a house," _huser_ "houses."
_skema_ "schema or schemata," _skemet_ "a schema," _skemer_ "schemata."
_du_ "oak," _duvet_ "an oak," _duver_ "oaks." _ski_ "ski or skis," _skighet_
"a ski," _skigher_ "skis."

### The Definite Article

There are two kinds of definite noun phrases: long and short. In long phrases,
the definite article is a separate word _en_ which precedes the noun.
In short phrases, the definite article is a suffix _-en_ on the noun stem. This
follows any number suffix.

Examples: _en hus_, _husen_ "the house(s), the shelter," _en huset_, _huseten_
"the house," _en huser_, _huseren_ "the houses."

### The Genitive Case

The genitive case is formed by _-s_. If the stem ends in _-s_, the suffix
becomes _-es_.

The genitive suffix is most often used with proper nouns. When applied to
common nouns, it sounds rather archaic.

E.g. _Dunyskamers_ "of the Dunish people"

## Verbal Morphology

### The participle

The dictionary form of a verb is the active participle.

### Finite forms

Verbs have two finite forms: proximal and distal. Each of these has long and
short forms.

The short proximal form of a verb is created by suffixing _-er_ to the stem.
This suffix merges with any existing _-e_ to become _-ër_. The long proximal
form is created by preceding the verb with a separate particle _er_.

The distal form of a verb is created by suffixing _-de_ to the stem. This
becomes _-te_ after a voiceless consonant, including _-gh_. The long distal
form is created by preceding the verb with a separate particle _de_.

Examples: _jegh viler gat_ "I will go," _jegh vilde gat_ "I would go," _jegh er loffe_
"I love," _jegh de loffe_ "I loved," _jegh loffër_ "I love," _jegh loffede_
"I loved," _jegh Duniskte_ "I was / would be Dunish," _jegh sëghte_ "I was seen."

In speech and casual writing, the tense particle _er_ is often contracted onto
a preceding pronoun, e.g. _jegh'r ga_ "I go," _vi'r ga_ "we go," etc.

### Voice

In addition to the active voice, verbs with valence greater than 0 have a
passive and a middle voice. The passive voice promotes the first complement
to subject position and removes all other complements. The middle voice simply
removes all complements. The result is that both passive and middle voice verbs
always have a valence of 0.

The passive voice is formed by _-egh_, and the middle voice is formed
by _-e_. These voice suffixes are added before the proximal/distal tense
suffixes.

### The infinitive

The infinitive has a long and a short form. The short form is created by a
suffix _-æ_, which replaces any final vowel. The long form adds to this a
separate particle _æt_ preceding the verb. When the long form is used,
complements without trailing modifiers can be inserted between the particle
and the verb.

An infinitive verb keeps its valence. The infinitive is only used with the
active voice; middle- and passive-voice verbs use the gerund instead (see
below).

Examples: _sæ migh_, _æt sæ migh_, _æt migh sæ_ "to see me."

### The gerund

The gerund is essentially an infinitive with valence zero. It is formed by
_-et_.

_Vi'r vil sëghet_ "We will see." _Loffeghet forliter_ "To be loved is hard."

### The agentive suffix

A noun referring to the subject of a verb can be formed from the verb stem by
a suffix _-am_. After the passive _-gh_, this shortens to _-m_.

Examples: _Dunyskam_ "Dunish folk," _laffam_ "singer," _høram_ "hearer,"
_lædheghm_ "lessee."

### Phrasal tenses

The perfect and prospective tenses are formed phrasally, with the verbs
_ha_ "have" or _vil_ "will" followed by a nonfinite form.

Examples: _jegh'r vil laffet_ "I will sing," _jegh'r ha laffet_ "I have sung."

Note that _ha_ has an irregular stem _hau-_. Example: _hun hauer laffet_ "She
has sung."

### Table of verb forms

|            | Active  | Middle | Passive |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| Participle | -       | -e     | -egh    |
| Proximal   | -er     | -ër    | -egher  |
| Distal     | -de/-te | -ede   | -eghte  |
| Nominal    | -æ      | -et    | -eghet  |
| Agent      | -am     | -am    | -eghm   |

### Valence

## Modifiers

## Declarative Sentences

## Copula

The copular verb _ba_ is used to equate two nouns.

Example: _Aragorn bade Gondors Kÿning_ "Aragorn was King of Gondor."

The middle voice of the copula, _be_, means "exist."

Example: _Dræger ikkæ bër_ "Dragons do not exist."

The copula is never used with adjective-like verbs.

Example: _En Dunysk mal er fryn_ "The Dunysk language is easy," not _\*En Dunysk mal ber fryn._
