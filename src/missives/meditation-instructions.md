# Meditation Instructions

1. Sit upright. Close your eyes.
2. Relax and feel good.
3. Become fully aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations, including breath sensations.
4. Shift your mind into neutral and Just Sit. No need to pursue or fight any train of thought or any sensation.
5. Make adjustments as needed to keep doing steps 1–4.

There is nothing esoteric about this process; it's quite ordinary. The mental
attitude is the same as when you are sitting in a beautiful place, sipping your
favorite beverage, with nothing else to do. It's only the _results_ of this
process, repeated habitually hundreds of times, that are extraordinary.
