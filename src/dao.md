# Dào Dé Jīng

<pre>

The tao that can be told
is not the eternal Tao
The name that can be named
is not the eternal Name.

The unnamable is the eternally real.
Naming is the origin
of all particular things.

Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

Yet mystery and manifestations
arise from the same source.
This source is called darkness.

Darkness within darkness.
The gateway to all understanding.

## Heading level two

In a poorly-structured codebase, all the code has a similar texture. Everywhere you look, it’s approximately the same: a mishmash of different stuff. A bit of SQL, a bit of calculation, a sprinkling of HTML. Every function seems to operate on a mixture of domain concepts and language-level primitives.

When concerns are separated, on the other hand, there is contrast between the parts. The UI code looks very different from the database access code. When you open a file, you can tell at a glance what type of thing it is, and know where it fits in the architecture.

Sandi Metz has a technique she calls the squint test: you lean back and squint at the code, looking for changes in shape and changes in color. The more coherence and consistency you see in each part, the better the code is.

> For functional and cognitive clarity, contrast is [...] practically necessary: the shop in the neighborhood is different from the houses next to it. [... Contrast] allows each center to take its proper nature. It permits more intensive attention to individual functions. And it creates a feeling of distinction which relaxes people, because it acknowledges and permits different dimensions of experience.

> Contrast is the thing which creates differentiation, and allows differentiation. It is the differentiation of the void which gives birth to matter. All differentiation requires that contrast is created in space, in order to give birth to anything at all.
