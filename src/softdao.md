# The Dao of Software Development

What can even be said about software development?<br>
Hell if I know.<br>
My words turn to dust in my mouth;<br>
What I know doesn't fit into words.

It is not a study, but an act:<br>
Not a plan, but a process.<br>
No, even that's not quite right.<br>
Oh what am I to do?

> The way that can be told<br>
> is not the eternal Way<br>
> The name that can be named<br>
> is not the eternal Name.

> The unnamable is the eternally real.<br>
> Naming is the origin<br>
> of all particular things. 

There are two types of software developers:<br>
Call them Achilles and Socrates.<br>
Achilles asks "how do I ...?"<br>
Socrates asks "what is a...?"<br>
Achilles goes fast. Socrates goes far.

Achilles only sees the surface.<br>
Chasing desire, he struggles with one special case after another.<br>
Socrates does not struggle. He has found the Origin<br>
Which does nothing, yet produces everything.

> Free from desire, you realize the mystery.<br>
> Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.
>
> Yet mystery and manifestations<br>
> arise from the same source.<br>
> This source is called darkness.
>
> Darkness within darkness.<br>
> The gateway to all understanding.

If you tell people you want something, they'll try to give it to you,<br>
by hook or by crook.

Once, I was working in a codebase where development had become slow and painful.
The other developers didn't seem to care. Frustrated, I tidied part of the code
to show them what it could be like. Once they saw how nice things could be,
they too were dissatisfied with the way things were. Many left the company for
greener pastures, and the project failed.

I thought I was creating ease, efficiency, beauty. And so I was — but at the
same time, I was creating their opposites.

> When people see some things as beautiful,<br>
> other things become ugly.<br>
> When people see some things as good,<br>
> other things become bad.
>
> Being and non-being create each other.<br>
> Difficult and easy support each other.<br>
> Long and short define each other.<br>
> High and low depend on each other.<br>
> Before and after follow each other.
>
> Therefore the Master<br>
> acts without doing anything<br>
> and teaches without saying anything.<br>
> Things arise and she lets them come;<br>
> things disappear and she lets them go.<br>
> She has but doesn't possess,<br>
> acts but doesn't expect.<br>
> When her work is done, she forgets it.<br>
> That is why it lasts forever. 

What should I have done differently? Perhaps my mistake was showing the
"shining city on the hill" before my teammates had the skill, or the
determination, to get there themselves. I led where others couldn't yet follow.

What do you do when you are confused?<br>
The worst thing is to keep going.<br>
Second worst, to try to go back.<br>
When Achilles loses the way, only Socrates can find it again.<br>
If all else fails, take a nap.
