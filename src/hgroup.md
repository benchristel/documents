# The `hgroup` Element

By Ben Christel

</hgroup>

This document has an `<hgroup>`. See if you can guess how it works.

In a poorly-structured codebase, all the code has a similar texture. Everywhere you look, it’s approximately the same: a mishmash of different stuff. A bit of SQL, a bit of calculation, a sprinkling of HTML. Every function seems to operate on a mixture of domain concepts and language-level primitives.

When concerns are separated, on the other hand, there is contrast between the parts. The UI code looks very different from the database access code. When you open a file, you can tell at a glance what type of thing it is, and know where it fits in the architecture.

#### This is an `h4` element

Do you really need an `hgroup` for this?
